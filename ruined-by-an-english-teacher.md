# See how you are ruined by your English teacher

近段时间在某平台某些英语教学的直播中，我看到好几次一些English tutors提到**先行词**这个概念，随着还当作一个知识点来考现场的观众。我就纳闷了为啥要引入这个概念呢？

我们先看个例子先。

`This is the ice cream I like eating in summer.`

According to the definition of `先行词`, `ice cream` in this sentence is called `先行词`. Why call it `先行词`? In this case the word `ice cream` is just a normal **object** in a basic sentence structure and there is no need to highlight it. In fact, there is no such a concept called `先行词` in English grammer. So why complicate a simple thing in the education of English grammar in China?

也不知道谁首先发明了`先行词`这个多余的概念，无疑给英语学习者增加了负担和困惑。

我猜之所以发明`先行词`这个概念是相对于中文的语序来说，`ice cream`一词确实是先行了。这句英文对应的中文是

`这是我夏天喜欢吃的冰淇淋🍦。`

`先行词`这个概念在英语教学中的引入恰恰反映了为了教语法而教语法的怪象。实质上是本末倒置，只观其表而不观其里。

Why this order in an English sentence? In fact, it is related to thinking in English or natural thinking underneath.

让我们再看几个例子。

`Please give me the book on the shelf. （请拿书架上那本书给我）`

`The bird twittering in the tree looks very happy. (在树上叽叽喳喳的鸟看起来很开心）`

这又引出了第二个话题，即英语思考方式或思考方式。其实英语的这种思维方式是更接近人的自然思考方式，而现代白话文是反应不出这种思维方式的，反而有些古文反应得出。不知其他的语言如德语也是这种语序呢？

*to do: show a diagram on thinking layers here*

Let's inspect these thinking layers a little bit now.

Can someone think without any language? Definitely, you can confirm it by observing the babies or children.

First we think and then we process our thinking in a specific language such as Chinese, English or any other language.

Later I will make a complete article or video on thinking in English.
