# Learn oral English by watching cartoons

Watching cartoons on TV is a great way to learn or improve your oral English.

My nephew, a five-year-old child, likes watching Peppa Pig very much. I think Peppa Pig is a great material not only for children to learn English but also for adults who want to learn English as a second language because in it there are many daily English like conversations between friends and families and you can learn a lot of daily vocabulary and phrases.

因为小孩子学口语是无师自通的，下面这个视频我主要是面向大人，特别是已经学过英语来说的，谈谈我的一些经验。

## 为什么看动画片是非常有效的

Because there is an exact mapping between what you hear and what you see, there is no translation interface among them to annoy you or interfere with your thinking.

举个简单的例子，当你第一次听到tree这个声音时，又同时看到🌲这个物体时，你就不需要树这个中文啦。You are learning in a native way insteading of doing translation stuff.
