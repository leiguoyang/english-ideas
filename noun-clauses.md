# Noun clauses (名词从句)

A noun clause is one of the three classes of subordinate clauses （从句）, which is noun clauses （名词从句）, adjectival clauses （形容词从句） and adverb clauses （副词从句）.

A noun clause is a clause that acts as a noun. For example,

```
Don't care about why I'm putting it upside down.
```

This sentence is said by a girl at the age of 4 when she is putting a folder into her bag before going to school. In this sentence, the part **`why I'm putting it upside down`** is a noun clause.

Let's check more examples.

```
What you said doesn't make any sense.
```

**`What you said`** is a noun clause in this sentence.

```
He says that he will come back later.
```

**`that he will come back later`** is a noun clause.

```
The fact that it is hard to learn English well as second language is common to many people.
```

**`The fact that it is hard to learn English well as second language`** is noun clause.

在中国的英语语法教育体系中，通常你听到的宾语从句、主语从句和同位语从句其实都是noun clauses. 其实没必要分得这么细，你只需要记住noun clause这个概念就好了。

It's unreasonable to classify a clause into 宾语从句、主语从句和同位语从句 because a clause is classified by parts of speech such as noun clauses, adjectival clauses and adverb clauses.
